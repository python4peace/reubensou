    <h1>Strength to Stand</h1>
    <h2>by Reuben W. Gobah (Reuben Soul)</h2>

    <p class="warning">⚠️ WARNING: Don’t try this at home. Anyone else would break their neck. Right now, Reuben Soul is the only one in the world who does this.</p>

    <img src="strength_to_stand_cover.jpg" alt="Reuben Soul Book Cover">

    <p><strong>Strength to Stand</strong> is more than a book—it's a powerful story of transformation, loss, peace, and unbreakable will. Reuben lost 30% of his family to civil war, yet rose to become the <strong>World Peace and Fitness Ambassador in Los Angeles in 2023</strong>. He ran marathons, helped thousands regain their health, and now shares this message with the world.</p>

    <p><strong>Reuben's strength is unmatched.</strong> In a feat no one else dares attempt, he stands balanced on two balls while lifting 30 pounds overhead. This cover photo is real—and dangerous. His message: unity, healing, strength, and hope for all people, whether they agree with each other or not.</p>
